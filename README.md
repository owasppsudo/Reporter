### Capabilities of the Code

This code implements a highly sophisticated Telegram bot called "World Reporter," designed to collect and process reports about content or entities across multiple social media platforms. Below are its key capabilities:

1. **Multi-Platform Reporting**:
   - Supports reporting on platforms like Telegram, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, Reddit, Discord, Snapchat, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, and a custom "other" category.
   - Each platform has specific reportable categories (e.g., "tweet" for Twitter, "video" for YouTube).

2. **Dynamic User Authentication**:
   - Users provide their own Telegram API credentials (`phone_number`, `api_id`, `api_hash`) and authentication code interactively through the bot.
   - Creates a unique Telegram client session per user, stored as `{SESSION_NAME}_{chat_id}`.

3. **API Token Management**:
   - Allows users to set API tokens for supported platforms using the `/set_token <platform> <token>` command.
   - Tokens are stored securely in a SQLite database and used to submit reports to platform APIs where applicable.

4. **Multi-Language Support**:
   - Users can choose their preferred language (e.g., "en" for English, "es" for Spanish) at the start.
   - All bot responses are translated using the `googletrans` library.

5. **Report Collection and Storage**:
   - Collects detailed reports including text, media (images/videos), URLs, and platform-specific IDs.
   - Saves reports to both JSON files in the `reports` directory and a SQLite database (`reporter.db`).
   - Generates a JWT verification token for each report.

6. **Media and URL Analysis**:
   - Downloads media attachments from Telegram messages and stores them locally.
   - Analyzes URLs provided in reports, extracting titles and descriptions using `BeautifulSoup`.

7. **External API Submission**:
   - Submits reports to platform-specific APIs (e.g., Twitter, YouTube) if a token is provided and the platform supports it.
   - Handles platforms without public APIs (e.g., WhatsApp, Snapchat) by storing reports locally without API submission.

8. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Limits users to 5 reports per minute to prevent abuse, enforced by the `ratelimit` library.

9. **Report Verification**:
   - Users can verify their reports using `/verify <token>` with the JWT token provided after submission.
   - Updates the report status to "verified" in the database.

10. **Analytics**:
    - Provides global analytics with the `/analytics` command, showing report counts per platform and total verified reports.

11. **Database Management**:
    - Uses SQLite to store:
      - `reports`: Report details (platform, category, details, media, URLs, status, etc.).
      - `users`: User data (language, report count, last report timestamp, Telegram credentials).
      - `credentials`: Platform-specific API tokens per user.

12. **Error Handling and Logging**:
    - Comprehensive logging to `reporter.log` for debugging and tracking actions/errors.
    - Graceful handling of authentication failures, API errors, and invalid inputs.

13. **Interactive Workflow**:
    - Guides users through a state machine (`user_states`) to collect all necessary inputs step-by-step.

### How to Use the Bot

#### Prerequisites
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install telethon aiohttp aiofiles googletrans==3.1.0a0 pyjwt pytz ratelimit aiohttp_socks beautifulsoup4
   ```
2. **Obtain Telegram API Credentials**:
   - Go to [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org), log in with your phone number, and create an app to get an `api_id` and `api_hash`.

#### Running the Bot
1. **Start the Script**:
   ```bash
   python reporter.py
   ```
   The bot will start and log "World Reporter is running..." to the console and `reporter.log`.

2. **Interact with the Bot**:
   - Open Telegram and message the bot (you'll need to know its username or use it in a private chat where it’s already added).

#### Step-by-Step Usage
1. **Initiate the Bot**:
   - Send: `/start`
   - Bot: "Welcome to World Reporter! Please provide your phone number (e.g., +1234567890) to authenticate with Telegram:"
   - You: `+1234567890`

2. **Provide API Credentials**:
   - Bot: "Please provide your API ID from my.telegram.org:"
   - You: `1234567` (your API ID)
   - Bot: "Please provide your API Hash from my.telegram.org:"
   - You: `a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0` (your API hash)

3. **Authenticate with Telegram**:
   - Bot: "Please enter the code you received on Telegram:"
   - You: `12345` (code sent to your phone)
   - Bot: "Authentication successful! Please choose your language (e.g., 'en' for English, 'es' for Spanish):"
   - You: `en`

4. **Choose a Platform**:
   - Bot: "Which platform do you want to report? Options: telegram, instagram, twitter, ..."
   - You: `twitter`

5. **Set API Token (if required)**:
   - Bot: "Please provide your API token for Twitter (use /set_token twitter <token> to set it later if you don’t have it now):"
   - You: `/set_token twitter abc123xyz` (or type `skip` to proceed without a token)
   - Bot: "Token for twitter set successfully!"
   - Bot: "What do you want to report on Twitter? Options: account, tweet, dm"
   - You: `tweet`

6. **Submit Report Details**:
   - Bot: "Please provide details for your Twitter tweet report (include URLs or IDs if applicable):"
   - You: `This tweet is spam: https://twitter.com/user/status/123456789`
   - Bot: "Thank you! Your report has been recorded. Verify it with /verify <token>...\nUse /start to report again or /stats to see your stats."

7. **Verify the Report**:
   - Send: `/verify <token>` (replace `<token>` with the JWT token provided)
   - Bot: "Report verified successfully!"

8. **Check Stats**:
   - Send: `/stats`
   - Bot: "You have submitted 1 reports. Last report: <timestamp>"

9. **View Analytics**:
   - Send: `/analytics`
   - Bot: "Global Analytics:\nTwitter: 1 reports\nTotal Verified Reports: 0"

#### Additional Commands
- **Set Token Later**:
  - Send: `/set_token <platform> <token>` (e.g., `/set_token youtube xyz789`)
  - Bot: "Token for <platform> set successfully!"

#### Notes
- **API Tokens**: For platforms like Twitter, Instagram, etc., you need to obtain API tokens from their developer portals (e.g., Twitter Developer Portal, Meta for Developers). Without tokens, reports are stored locally but not submitted to the platform APIs.
- **Platforms Without APIs**: WhatsApp, Snapchat, and Discord lack public reporting APIs, so reports for these are only stored locally.
- **Media**: Attach images/videos when providing report details, and they’ll be downloaded and included.
- **Security**: The `SECRET_KEY` is hardcoded here; in production, consider making it user-provided or environment-based for better security.

### Example Workflow
- `/start` → `+1234567890` → `1234567` → `a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0` → `12345` → `en` → `twitter` → `/set_token twitter abc123xyz` → `tweet` → `Spam tweet: https://twitter.com/user/status/123456789` → `/verify <token>` → `/stats`

This bot is a powerful, user-driven tool for reporting content across platforms, with extensive customization and interactivity. Let me know if you need help with specific platforms or features!
